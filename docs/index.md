This is a reference guide for who we are and the way we do things. It’s a handbook for anyone in the Planning Data team that tells us the ‘right way’ to do things.

What’s written here is the way we do things now, but that will change from time to time.

## Contribute to the handbook

Contributions from anyone on the team are welcome and encouraged! This handbook is currently in its early stages of development, and we’re still testing out what content and guidance is useful.

Follow the [contribution guide](https://github.com/digital-land/service-handbook/blob/main/contributing.md) to add to our handbook.
