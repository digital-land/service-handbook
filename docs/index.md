This handbook is for people working on the Planning Data service.

It documents who we are, how we are organised, how we work, and what we believe are the best way to do things.

This is a live document. What’s written here is the way we do things now, but that will change from time to time as we learn.

Contributions from anyone are welcome and encouraged! This handbook is currently in its early stages of development, and we’re still testing out what content and guidance is useful to our team.
