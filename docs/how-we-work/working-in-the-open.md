title: Working in the open
---

<!-- With thanks to Emily Webber for her contribution to this guide! -->

Working in the open has been one of the team’s core values since the very beginning. We’re open and accountable. We publish our code in the open, we write about what we do, and we invite others in.

## Why work in the open?

One of the Government Design Principles is [make things open: it makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better).

Open and agile communication from everyone across the programme can help keep users, people, teams, other organisations and stakeholders interested, engaged and up-to-date about what we are doing. 

Talking about our work openly – not hiding it or making it hard to find – increases our reach and invites people to join the conversation. It brings [participation, agility, momentum, leverage and better feedback loops](https://visitmy.website/2020/01/25/blogging-working-open/#whats-the-point-of-being-open).

Similarly, making [our code](https://github.com/digital-land/), [roadmaps](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/about/roadmap), [performance](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/about/performance) and [project boards](https://github.com/orgs/digital-land/projects) available helps people see what we’ve done, what we’re doing, and where we’re going. They're welcomed to [get involved](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-contribute-to-the-data-design-process), [submit pull requests](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land.github.io/pull/7), ask questions and [provide helpful information](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/25#discussioncomment-6678177). 

It also works as a great recruitment tool, exciting and inspiring new talent to join our mission.

This short guide is meant to help share the why, what, and how of working in the open.

**Our comms should**

* be simple, clear, brief and regular  
* come from everyone  
* move as fast as the work does  
* show the actual work  
* build a long-term narrative  
* celebrate all wins  
* use the human voice

In general, 99% of delivery work should be open.

## What should I talk about?

Sharing milestones and achievements is always good, but working in the open creates stories out of day-to-day work – sharing what we did and how we did it. So, rather than building up to big announcements, you can share more of what you did along the way. 

### You can talk about
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| --- | --- |
| **Something we did for users.** Include how it helped them, what you learnt, photos and quotes. | **A knotty problem we unpicked.** Include details on the problem, its size, why solving it was important, what you did, and the outcome for users or your team. 
| **How we changed our mind.** Include initial assumptions, what you learnt, and what decisions the new thinking has enabled. | **How we approach things as a team (our ways of working).** Include new methods and techniques, technical notes, design principles and documentation. |

## Be careful not to talk about

Aim to be as open as you can, but remember that you should not share:

* anything classified as secret or top secret  
* anything a Minister or senior civil servant should or will be announcing  
* anything that breaks the Civil Service Code  
* any personal information about anyone without their permission

If in doubt, ask your service owner.
