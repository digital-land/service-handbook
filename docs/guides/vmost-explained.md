title: VMOST explained

The Digital Planning portfolio is adopting the VMOST framework to better align its work with MHCLG’s vision for digital planning in England.

## What is VMOST?

VMOST stands for Vision, Mission, Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics. It's a framework that connects the portfolio's long-term vision with actionable steps.

The framework should help the portfolio stay on track, promote cohesive work, and enable data-driven decisions. It should also increase stakeholder confidence of the directed work the portfolio is undertaking.

## Vision
Make the planning system in England fit for the 21st century by scaling the foundations of the planning system. AI is the ‘golden thread’ that runs through the design. Success will be the achievement of the Government Mission to build 1.5 million homes this Parliament. 

## Mission
Scale the foundations that enable the planning system to transform and to enable more development, leveraging the power of AI at every available opportunity.

### Sub mission 1

Enable faster plan making to ensure the right infrastructure, strategic and local plans in place so that development can happen significantly faster.

### Sub mission 2 

Enable faster and better decision making to reduce the time it takes to get a planning decision so that the cost, uncertainty and risks of development are reduced.

### Sub mission 3

Unlock data needed for an efficient planning and housing system so that we can see how the system is performing (getting things developed), enable faster planning decisions and plan making to unlock development.

## How our work fits into VMOST

The VMOST framework can be confusing at first, it takes words we've used to describe our ways of working and changes the meaning. But we can easily map the phrases and see how our ways of working bolt on to the VMOST framework.

We have three persistent 'objectives' (or capabilities) that will help us achieve our sub-mission:

- Designing data standards that work well for data providers _and_ data consumers
- Collecting, indexing and managing data, helping improve its quality and trustworthiness
- Providing a platform which makes it as easy and reliable as possible to use and re-use the data

These 'objectives' map to our teams. These are persistent in that they are never fully achieved or finished, and we continuously improve our data standards, the data and its trustworthiness, and the platform.

However, we can put a stake in the ground and set a goal for making improvements using 'strategies' – and we've been creating 'strategies' for the last 12 months.

A strategy can be broken down into:

- a big goal we want to achieve (like the objective of an OKR)
- a series of steps to achieve that goal (like the initiatives we plan, which VMOST calls 'tactics')
- a set of measures that help us measure progress (like the key results we set)
- a bunch of work we bring into sprints (like the tasks we use to complete initiatives)
