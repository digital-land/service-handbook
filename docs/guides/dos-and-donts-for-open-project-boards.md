title: Dos and don’ts for open project boards
---

Opening up your project or Kanban boards invites our users, partners and stakeholders to see our work and make contributions. For example, we can share a task with a colleague in Slack or show a stakeholder that we're working on something. It's one of the benefits of [working in the open](/how-we-work/working-in-the-open/).

There's some basic hygiene for working on open project boards which has helped teams like [GOV.‌UK Design System](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) engage with users and stakeholders for years.

## Dos and dont's 

- **Remind yourself of security and confidentiality responsibilities.** Check the MHCLG intranet for guidance on [security and confidentiality](https://intranet.communities.gov.uk/handbook/contents/security-data-and-confidentiality/security-and-confidentiality/) and [the need for greater openness in the work of government](https://intranet.communities.gov.uk/handbook/contents/security-data-and-confidentiality/use-of-official-publications/#Introduction).
- **Quickly read up on [security classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications/government-security-classifications-policy-quick-read-html).** Most of our work falls under OFFICIAL status. Some of it may be sensitive, but the majority of delivery work isn't. We rarely work on anything SECRET.
- **If you need to use someone's name, don't write out full names.** Use someone's first name and the intial of their surname, plus their organisation – Joe S, Borchester – if you need to refer to a person. Lots of people share their full names, job titles and who they work for on LinkedIn, but not everyone. (You can use someone's GitHub handle, e.g. @stevenjmesser, without permission.)
- **Use access control on documents and links you share.** Use sharing settings to send a document or link to a specific person, controlling who can access it. Don't give access to the outside world by default.
- **Don't comment on individuals or organisations in an objectionable way.** You're representing MHCLG and the department, so don't say anything that would bring our work into disrepute. (You can share grumbles and opinions in a safe, closed space like Slack.)
- **Be clear, give context.** Your team-mates need clarity to be effective. You may only need to neuter your words if there's a security risk, privacy risk or a delicate relationship to maintain.
- **If you're working on something that's already mentioned in the public domain, you can talk about it openly.** Just make sure to follow the other dos and don'ts. 
- **Add issues to a private repo if anything must remain hidden.** A GitHub project board can show issues from multiple repositories. You can add issues to a private repo if needs be, and this will keep information hidden. It's probably sensible to keep policy-related matters in access-controlled documents and emails, to protect against leaks.
- **You can still make mistakes.** We know that no one is perfect and new ways of working can take time to get used to. You probably won't make any big mistakes or release confidential information, but ask your service owner if unsure.
