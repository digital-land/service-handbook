title: Quarterly planning
---

Every 3 months, we take the opportunity to step back from the day-to-day and consider the objectives we’re working towards. These objectives help us progress towards achieving our strategic goals in chunks. The quarterly checkpoint is a time to refocus efforts and double-down, change direction or move on to the next objective.

There are 3 stages to using the quarterly checkpoint well:

1. Check on your progress  
2. Set new objectives  
3. Plan how to achieve your objectives (old and new)

You’ll need to run a workshop for each stage, but you can combine them into one workshop if you like. Whatever works.

## Check on your progress

Start this 30 days before the new quarter starts.

First, check on the progress your team has made on your objectives and key results (OKRs – here’s an [explainer on OKRs](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/:p:/r/sites/DigitalPlanning/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E9CC5D4-9569-410E-BBDF-580F84A08676%7D&file=Digital%20Planning%20OKR%27s%20Guidance%20.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&wdOrigin=TEAMS-WEB.p2p_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1733406660384&web=1)). You can do this in a team workshop lasting 30 to 60 minutes.

### 1\. List out the OKRs you’ve been working on (10 to 20 mins) 

Run through the OKRs you’ve been working on. Talk about the progress you made on each key result and celebrate the successes – big or small\! 

### 2\. Think about what’s left to do (20 to 40 mins) 

For any OKRs you haven’t completed – where progress on key results isn’t 100% – discuss as a team which initiatives you have left to do to fully achieve the objective. For example, you may need to collect some data, run a test, build a thing or achieve an outcome.

Consider whether you should change your approach, for example, by doing something smaller or using different methods, based on what you’ve learned over the last quarter. It’s OK to stick to the original plan if it’s still the best approach. 

If you think you should stop or deprioritise working on an old unfinished objective, have a chat with Paul. 

## Set new objectives 

If you’ve completed all the objectives you set last quarter, well done\! You should celebrate. 

You probably need to set new objectives. Have a look at the Strategies in the [VMOST whiteboard](https://app.mural.co/t/mhclg2837/m/mhclg2837/1741707963960/643ec474684f9ff5fa550593ab5bed63f381f601) for your team. These are example objectives you can adopt or adapt. These objectives should help us reach the targets for our sub-mission.

There's a [guide to VMOST](/guides/vmost-explained/) in this handbook.

## Plan how to achieve your objectives (old and new) 

Next, you’ll need to form a loose plan for how to achieve your old and new objectives. 

Run another workshop lasting 30 to 45 minutes for each objective.

Everyone on the team will need to input on the plan using the outline below. Write it in a doc, a slide deck or on a whiteboard – whatever works. You will need to share these plans with other team leads in a roadmapping session at the start of the new quarter, so that we can highlight dependencies and conflicts.

If it’s easier than starting with a blank page, team leads can fill in the outline and get feedback from the rest of the team. As long as everyone gets a chance to input, it doesn’t matter. It’s OK if you take less than 30 minutes, especially if you already have a plan.

You don’t have to follow the steps below, for example, Data Design take a slightly different approach to think about their initiatives and workstreams. Speak to Liz if you’d like to see it\!

### 1\. Write down and describe the objective 

An objective is a bold and qualitative goal that the organisation wants to achieve.

It’s best that they’re ambitious, not super easy to achieve, or audacious in nature; they are not sales targets.

Write down the problem you’re solving and who it’s a problem for. Discuss how you’ll know when you’re done. What are the success criteria?

### 2\. Think about risks and unknowns 

What might be a challenge? What are the riskiest assumptions or big unknowns to highlight? Do you need to try new techniques? These might form the first initiatives in your plan.

You can frame your assumptions using the hypothesis statement:

**Because** \[of something we think or know\]  
**We believe that** \[an initiative or task\]  
**Will achieve** \[desired outcome\]  
**Measured by** \[metric\]

**Make sure** to note down any dependencies you have on other teams, for example, where you may need another team to do something for you. You’ll need these in a roadmapping session with other team leads.

### 3\. Detail all the initiatives 

Write a sentence for all the initiatives – tasks and activities – you’ll need to do to achieve the objective. 

Consider research and discovery activities, which can help you gather information to turn unknowns into knowns. Consider alphas, things to prototype, spikes, and experiments that can help you de-risk or validate assumptions. Make sure to remember the development and delivery work too – that’s how we release value to users\!

You can sketch out when initiatives might happen if it helps. You can make a copy of the [quarterly roadmap template](https://app.mural.co/t/mhclg2837/m/mhclg2837/1725026495193/ee9ace50bcc18581c179c734c859b5682031b9e1?sender=u5e6d2d6a1d782ac443741061) to lay things out.

### 4\. What will you measure? 

Review your success criteria. Define the metrics that will tell you when you’ve finished or achieved the objective. These should tell you when you’re done and will become your key results.

Remember, metrics should be:

* tangible and quantitative  
* specific and measurable  
* achievable and realistic

### 5\. Prioritise radically 

Now you have your initial objectives and initiatives, ask yourself how you will order and structure the work. Think about opportunities for taking a minimally viable or lean approach.

You might want to ask questions like:

* What would you do differently if you only had half the time?   
* How will you start small and build up?   
* What’s the least amount of work you can do to learn the most? 

Use these thoughts to consider any changes to your initiatives. Go back and edit the initiatives if you need to.

## Get ready to present and iterate your OKRs and roadmap

You must do this 2 weeks before the new quarter starts or earlier.

Use the [OKRs template](https://mhclg.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/DigitalPlanning/Ed-sHarfPS5HgQR5cNBzCp4B1Qu4PBXqz0Nj2xYel_ciyg?e=LYMZ3J) to create a slide for each objective (make a copy). Fill in the key results, most important initiatives, and any risks.

Have a list of all the initiatives you’ve written up, and make sure to highlight where you have dependencies on other teams. 

You must have drafted new objectives ready for review with the service owner 2 weeks before the new quarter starts or earlier. This will allow you time to tweak and change objectives or key results, if needed. Please be proactive in organising these sessions with the service owner – get something in the diary early. It gives you a date to work towards.

## Finalise your OKRs and roadmap

You must finalise OKRs and your roadmap in the 7 days before a new quarter starts. 

Think about how your work will impact our KPIs over the quarter. It’s good to be able to explain that to the senior leadership team and describe the impact we’ll have for users.
