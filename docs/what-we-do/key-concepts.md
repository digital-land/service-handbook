There are a few key concepts that underpin the Planning Data service. Understanding these key concepts will help improve your understanding of the service and its vision.

If anything is unclear or you'd like to ask more questions, get in touch with our service owner or a team lead. And remember: there are no silly questions!

## Data 

Data is raw facts and figures, often stored in a digital format. Spend a day learning more about [data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zphqgdm/revision/1) and [databases](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zsfky4j/revision/1).

## Data service

A data service provides, manages, and processes data to make it accessible, usable, and actionable for various applications. This saves users from having to find, collect, clean, organise and share the data themselves. 

A data service is typically accessed through interfaces or APIs that allow integration with other applications and systems.

## Data specification

A data specification is a formal document that defines how data should be structured, formatted, stored and exchanged in a consistent way.

Each specification provides a set of rules and guidelines for producing and organising that data, ensuring that it can be read and understood by other systems without any confusion or errors.

Read more about [what we mean by a data specification](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/about/what-is-a-data-standard) and [what a data specification wonâ€™t do](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/about/what-is-a-data-standard#what-a-data-specification-wont-do). 

## Data standard

A data standard is a data specification which has been set as a standard. We set data standards through the Levelling Up & Regeneration Act 2023, which helps ensure that usable data will be provided reliably.

## Devolution

Devolution is the decentralisation of governmental power. Examples of devolution are the powers granted to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and to the Greater London and local authorities. 

Read more about [devolution](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/CBP-8599/). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes a diagram showing [the hierarchy of UK statistical geographies](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/documents/e1e916620c1a4794b7422a4e2f99943e/explore), which can help visualise the layers of devolution. (Not all areas on the diagram have powers, so it is not a diagram of devolution.)

## Indexing data

The platform does not host data on behalf of a data provider. Data providers publish data and tell us where it's hosted, which allows the platform to collect and index the data. 

It's valuable for data to be made available, in one place, through the platform. However, data providers often have a responsibility to provide the data, or they're the authoritative source. It's important that the data are available from the authoritative source as it can ensure a higher level of accuracy, reliability and credibility.

## Planning consideration

A planning consideration is something specific to an area that may impact the outcome of a planning decision.

For example, a national planning policy impacts what can be built across the whole of England, and a conservation area restricts what can be developed in that area.

## Planning decision

A planning decision is a decision made by a local planning authority (LPA) in response to a planning application. Read more about [determining a planning application](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/determining-a-planning-application).

## Open data

Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share. It is openly licensed, free at the point of use and non-personal. 

When government and public organisations release open data, it enables analysts, researchers, businesses and others to develop useful resources. For example, Citymapper uses Transport for London's open data to help people make the optimal journey across the city.
