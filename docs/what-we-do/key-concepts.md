There are a few key concepts that underpin the Planning Data service. Understanding these key concepts will help improve your understanding of the service and its vision.

If anything is unclear or you'd like to ask more questions, get in touch with our service owner or a team lead. And remember: there are no silly questions!

## Data 

Data is raw facts and figures, often stored in a digital format. Learn more about [data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zphqgdm/revision/1) and [databases](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zsfky4j/revision/1).

## Data service

A data service provides, manages, and processes data to make it accessible, usable, and actionable for various applications. This saves users from having to find, collect, clean, organise and share the data themselves. A data service is typically accessed through interfaces or APIs that allow integration with other applications and systems.

## Devolution

Devolution is the decentralisation of governmental power. Examples of devolution are the powers granted to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and to the Greater London and local authorities.

## Indexing data

The platform does not host data on behalf of a data provider. Data providers publish data and tell us where it's hosted, which allows the platform to collect and index the data. 

It's valuable for data to be made available, in one place, through the platform. However, data providers often have a responsibility to provide the data, or they're the authoritative source. It's important that the data are available from the authoritative source as it can ensure a higher level of accuracy, reliability and credibility.

## Planning consideration

A planning consideration is something specific to an area that may impact the outcome of a planning decision.

For example, a national planning policy impacts what can be built across the whole of England, and a conservation area restricts what can be developed in that area.

## Planning decision

A planning decision is a decision made by a local planning authority (LPA) in response to a planning application. Read more about [determining a planning application](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/determining-a-planning-application).

## Open data

Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share. It is openly licensed, free at the point of use and non-personal. 

When government and public organisations release open data, it enables analysts, researchers, businesses and others to develop useful resources. For example, Citymapper uses Transport for London's open data to help people make the optimal journey across the city.
