This sub-service makes it easy for local planning authorities and other organisations to provide high quality, trustworthy data. It actively manages data to ensure completeness, uniqueness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and accuracy. 

Data providers can use the sub-service to [prepare, provide and maintain planning data](https://submit.planning.data.gov.uk/) with clear steps and actionable feedback provided along the way. The sub-service gives local authorities a view of data about their area from other sources, allowing them to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date data is available. 

The sub-service also maintains and operates data processing, providing live support for the wider service.
