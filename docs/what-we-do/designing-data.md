We speak to planners, policy-makers and people building digital services to identify and co-design data for planning in England. 

Our [data design process](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/data-design-process) determines what data is needed and should be made available on planning.data.gov.uk. The data design process is a collaborative and open process. We want all interested parties to be involved in the design of the data they need, produce and use, and we openly invite [contributions to the data design process](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-contribute).

The output of the process is a [technical specification](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-are-technical-specifications) that data providers can use to provide high-quality planning data. 

Once we have created, tested and verified the technical specification we start [collecting data](/what-we-do/collecting-data/) with more data providers.
