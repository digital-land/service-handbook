This sub-service is used by planners, policy-makers and people building digital services to highlight and co-design data for planning in England.

Through a [data design process](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/data-design-process), the data needed and that should be made available on planning.data.gov.uk is identified and determined. The data design process is a collaborative and open process. All interested parties are encouraged to be involved in the design of the data they need, produce and use, and they are openly invited to [contribute to the data design process](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/how-to-contribute).

The output of the process is a [technical specification](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-are-technical-specifications) that data providers can use to provide high-quality planning data. 

Once the technical specification has been created, tested and verified, more data providers are involved in [collecting data](/what-we-do/collecting-data/).
