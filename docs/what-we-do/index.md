## Vision

Our aim is to make the planning system fit for the 21st century by making planning and housing data easier to find, use and trust. 

Data is a key foundation that will enable the planning system to transform. For example, it's utilised by digital planning services (like [PlanX](https://www.planx.uk/How-it-works)) that can reduce delays in planning decisions and increase the success rate of planning applications. 

![A diagram of the Planning Data flywheel, illustrating a cyclical process. It starts with changing places (depicted by buildings, trees, and a wind turbine), which are administered by organisations collecting and standardising data. This data is made available nationally (shown as layered maps) and enables planning services (represented by hands using digital devices). These services inform decisions made by communities (depicted as a group of people), which lead back to changing places, completing the loop and reinforcing the cycle.](../assets/images/planning-data-flywheel.jpg)

We believe this will lead to: 

- better planning decisions 
- fewer uncertainties and delays in the housing system 
- more new digital services for property and planning 
- better relationships between communities and developments

### The problem we’re solving

Here is a short video to describe the problem we're working on.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UuugC3rV6QI?si=EkMoWgCYeAaX81fI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Planning decisions are [devolved](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/devolution/) across the country, which means planning data is devolved too. It's in paper files, maps, back-office systems, spreadsheets, databases, and various other places. If you want national or regional planning data, you need to visit each local planning authority (LPA) and collect it. You'll also need to collect data from other organisations, like flood risk zones from the Environment Agency or public transport access nodes from Department for Transport.

When you try to gather the data together, you'll find that it's described differently. Authorities don't always use the same headings and fields to record their tree preservation orders, for example. Or the [coordinate reference systems](https://resource.esriuk.com/blog/2012-3-26-coordinate-systems-and-projections-for-beginners-html/) are different, with one organisation using OSGB36 and another using WGS84. The data is not standarised and may not be interoperable. 

The data is hard to build upon because its quality isn't managed consistently across the country. This means the data can be patchy, with invalid fields, and it may not be up-to-date. This means the data isn't reliable and it's hard to trust.

You might find some data available elsewhere, on data.gov.uk, for example. But when you try to collect it, you may be asked to apply for a licence or pay for the data. Because planning data isn't openly available and can be expensive to procure from a private company, the market for digital planning services is squeezed, hampering innovation. Researchers and analysts in government may find themselves paying for data that has been produced by government, a waste of public money.

The Planning Data service aims to solve this by

- designing data standards that work well for data providers _and_ data consumers
- collecting, indexing and managing data, providing feedback on its quality, and
- providing a platform which make it as easy and reliable as possible to use and re-use the data.

This will make it easier to find, use and trust planning and housing data in England.

## Mission

Our goal and strategic focus for 2025 is to make data faster and provide data users with valuable, trustworthy data at national scale. By growing momentum and proving the scale of the platform, we can establish a healthy, sustainable ecosystem for planning and housing data in England.

## Our users

We're a data platform. We work with data providers to sustain a supply of useful, trustworthy data. We work with data users and consumers to understand and meet their needs. 

![A diagram shows data providers and data consumers connected through a central platform, planning.data.gov.uk with text: 'Designing data, Managing data, Using data at national scale.' Arrows indicate a flow of data and value from providers to consumers and back, forming a continuous cycle.](../assets/images/planning-data-platform-model.png)

It's possible for the organisation providing the data to use the data too, for example, local planning authorities provide data to be used in digital planning services like PlanX.

## Our service model

The Planning Data service has three main sub-services:

- Designing data standards that work well for data providers _and_ data consumers
- Collecting, indexing and managing data, providing feedback on its quality
- A platform which makes it as easy and reliable as possible to use and re-use the data

You can read more about [designing data](/what-we-do/designing-data/), [collecting data](/what-we-do/collecting-data/) and [using data](/what-we-do/using-data/).

## What success looks like

The Planning Data service will be achieving its aim if

- there is a healthy supply of useful, trustworthy data that is feasible for organisations to provide, and
- the data is utilised in a wide range of scenarios, in both the public and private sectors.

If we're successful in achieving our mission, there will be

- a healthy pipeline of data standards moving from the backlog to co-design and through to legislation
- continued participation from software providers, government bodies, LPAs and other interest groups in the data design process
- a clear picture of which data specifications will meet the needs of the planning system as a whole
- a growing supply of data provided by local planning authorities
- more trustworthy data provided over time, with minimal datasets meeting immediate needs
- useful and actionable feedback provided to data providers, helping them improve data quality and processes iteratively
- and more <!-- This list is unfinished -->

### Key performance indicators

Our North Star is the supply utilisation rate: how much of the data is being used. This helps ensure we're meeting the needs of data users in a way that maximises benefits for the public sector.

We also track availability, quality and coverage. You can see our key performance indicators on our [performance dashboard](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/about/performance). Each sub-service has its own key performance indicators.
