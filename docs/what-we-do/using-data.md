This sub-service makes it easier for PropTech organisations, property developers, analysts, policy officers, local planning authorities and other data consumers to make use of data about planning and housing.

Data consumers can use the sub-service to download datasets in multiple formats, integrate the API with their tools and software, plus find relevant tools and guidance which helps them make the most of datasets, registers and facts. 

The sub-service also maintains and operates the performance and reliability of APIs and our website.

## Key performance indicators

1. **Monthly active users (using APIs, downloads, pages)**
Shows the data being actively used, allowing for comparisons between previous months. Splitting usage by channel allows us to see which channel is most popular, and could help with calculating conversion rates.

2. **Monthly new users**
Shows that adoption is increasing amongst the intended users of the data, providing value. Could signal that engagement and communications activity is successful or needs more investment. 

3. **Data consumption per user**
Shows which users are increasing or decreasing their usage of the platform and its data. Can help with identifying which types of user need a better level of service, e.g. PropTech organisations.

4. **User satisfaction score**
Shows that we're providing a good service for data users and acting on their feedback. Low scores indicate that improvements need to be made, and high scores indicate that improvement efforts are being successful.

### API reliability KPIs

These KPIs show that the platform is reliable and available. These can be replaced with [service level indicators and objectives](https://gds-way.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/standards/slo.html) in future.
