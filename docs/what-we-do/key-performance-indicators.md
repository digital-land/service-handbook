title: Key performance indicators
---

These key performance indicators show that the platform is meeting its vision by making it easier to find, use and trust planning and housing data.

You can see our key performance indicators on our [performance dashboard](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/about/performance).

These KPIs are lagging indicators and each team has its own leading indicators. We used [guiding principles](https://boringmagi.cc/2025/05/08/metrics-measures-and-indicators/) to help shape these KPIs.

## North Star

Our North Star is the **supply utilisation rate**: how much of the data is being used. This helps ensure we're meeting the needs of data users in a way that maximises benefits for the public sector.

The **user satisfaction score** helps ensure we're providing a good service for data users and acting on their feedback.

## Availability

The **number of [datasets available on the platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/)** shows how we're making more planning and housing data available and working through the [planning considersations in our backlog](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/?stage=Backlog).

Many datasets have one owner providing the data nationally, such as flood risk zones provided by the Environment Agency. But there are some datasets compiled from data sources provided by local planning authorities (LPAs) across England. Some of these haven't been available at national scale before, such as tree preservation orders.

The **percentage of data sources provided by local planning authorities (out of those expected)** shows how we're working with more local planning authorities across England.

## Coverage

The **percentage of England covered by each dataset** shows how we're making planning and housing data available at national scale. 

The **percentage of local planning authorities providing data (out of all LPAs in England)** shows how we're enabling local planning authorities to contribute towards national datasets.

## Quality

The **percentage of data sources provided by local planning authorities without issues** shows how we're helping data owners improve the quality and trustworthiness of the data. 

The **percentage of required fields populated** shows data completeness for users of the data.
